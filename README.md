Project Brief: Generic RAG Application
Project Overview:
The Generic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Application is designed to provide users with a
dynamic chatbot experience, leveraging cutting-edge language models for general-purpose queries and
real-time information retrieval. Additionally, users can upload their own documents (e.g., PDFs) and ask the
chatbot specific questions based on the content of those documents. This dual functionality allows users to
benefit from both generic AI-powered responses and document-based insights.
Core Technologies:
● Frontend: Next.js
● Authentication & Authorization: NextAuth.js
● AI/LLM Handling: LangChain
● Backend Integration: FastAPI
● Database: MongoDB for user management
Key Features:
1. Chatbot Functionality (LLM-Based Responses):
○ The primary feature of the application is a chatbot interface that answers user queries using any
language model (LLM), such as GPT.
○ General Queries: The chatbot will generate responses based on the LLM’s capabilities for
general-purpose queries (e.g., trivia, explanations, advice).
○ Real-Time Information Retrieval: For real-time queries (e.g., weather, stock prices, etc.), the
chatbot will utilize LangChain’s browser API to fetch current data and return the information to
the user.
2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Feature:
○ Document Upload: Users can upload their own PDF documents, which will be stored securely
and associated with their account.
○ Document-Specific Q&A: The chatbot will retrieve relevant sections of the uploaded document
and generate accurate responses based on the content.
○ This feature empowers users to get customized, document-specific insights alongside general
chatbot capabilities.
Project Structure:
1. Frontend (Next.js):
○ Next.js will serve as the frontend framework to create an interactive and fast user experience.
○ The user interface includes:
■ A home page introducing the chatbot and its features.
■ A chat interface for interacting with the LLM.
■ An upload page where users can submit PDF documents
2. Authentication & Authorization (NextAuth.js):
○ Users will be required to create an account or log in to access key features (chatbot
interactions, document upload).
○ NextAuth.js will manage authentication flows and ensure secure access control, providing
options for social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.).
3. AI Handling (LangChain):
○ LangChain will connect the application to the selected LLM and handle real-time data fetching
for specific queries.
○ General AI Questions: LangChain will power LLM-based responses for user questions.
○ Real-Time Queries: For real-time information (e.g., “What’s the weather in London?”),
LangChain’s browser API will retrieve the latest data from external sources.
4. Backend API (FastAPI):
○ FastAPI will serve as the backend, handling user requests, processing uploaded files, and
interacting with the AI models.
○ FastAPI will also provide endpoints for file management (e.g., PDF upload, retrieval, and
deletion).
○ When a user asks a question about an uploaded document, FastAPI will handle the RAG
process by extracting text from the document and passing it to the AI model for response
generation.
5. Database (MongoDB):
○ MongoDB will store users information (e.g., username, email, password).
○ MongoDB will associate uploaded documents with specific users, ensuring that files and
document-based answers are kept secure and private.
Pages:
1. Home Page:
○ Overview: Introduction to the chatbot’s capabilities, including general AI responses and
document-based Q&A.
○ Call to Action: Buttons to start a conversation or upload a document.
2. Login/Sign-Up Page:
○ Authentication: Users sign up or log in via email or social providers (Google, GitHub) using
NextAuth.js.
○ Access Control: Required to access core features like the chatbot and document uploads.
3. Chatbot Page (LLM Interaction):
○ Main Interaction: Users can chat with the LLM for general questions.
○ Real-Time Queries: For real-time data (e.g., weather, stocks), the chatbot fetches live
information using LangChain’s browser API.
○ Simple UI: A clean chat interface with history viewing.
4. Generic RAG Page (Document Upload & Q&A):
○ Upload PDF: Users upload PDFs for document-specific Q&A.
○ Document Q&A: The chatbot answers user questions based on the uploaded document's
content using RAG.
User Flow:
1. Login and Access:
○ Users sign up or log in to access the chatbot and document upload features. The dashboard
displays previous uploads and chat history.
2. Chat Interaction:
○ Users can ask general questions through the chat interface. Responses are generated via the
integrated LLM (LangChain).
○ For real-time queries, the system fetches live data from external sources through LangChain.
3. RAG (Document-Specific Interaction):
○ Users can upload PDF documents via a designated page. The uploaded files are securely
stored, and the user can ask questions specific to the content of the document.
○ The system retrieves relevant portions from the document and generates answers.
Project Goals:
The objective is to build a flexible and user-friendly chatbot that:
1. Provides powerful, AI-based conversational abilities using LLMs for general queries.
2. Enhances user experience with real-time information retrieval.
3. Supports customized responses from user-uploaded documents using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG).
This project will be an ideal solution for users who need both general information from an AI model and
specific answers from their own documents.
By combining the strengths of Next.js, FastAPI, LangChain, and MongoDB, this application will offer an
efficient and scalable solution for both general chatbot interactions and document-specific queries.
